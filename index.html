<h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
<p>     The Data Wizards have read many news articles that stated San Francisco Bay Area Real Estate prices are high and growing exponentially .  

        We wanted to find out for ourselves if that is true so we could decide if we wanted to move elsewhere in our retirement.
        
        We identified 4 counties that we thought would represent California well (Shasta, Fresno, SF, LA) and looked at the recent 5 years for trends (2014-2018).
